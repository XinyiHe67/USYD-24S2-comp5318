# Comp5318 Assignment
## Introduction
This repository stores the code and reports of two assignments. Assignment1 needs to choose 4 different machine learning model as classifiers to finish a classification task, while Assignment2 needs to use 3 different deep learning methods 
to finish the classification task. In terms of Assignment2, the three architectures: ResNet-like, Efficient-like and simple CNN are all customized based on the traditional architectures of ResNet and EffcientNet.
